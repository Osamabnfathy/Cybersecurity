    "   - The JWT spec is extended by both the JSON Web Signature (JWS) and JSON Web Encryption (JWE) specifications, which define concrete ways of actually implementing JWTs.\n",

    ">> JWT format:\n",
    "   - A JWT consists of 3 parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. These are each separated by a dot\n",
    "   - The header and payload parts of a JWT are just base64url-encoded JSON objects.\n",
    "   - The header contains metadata about the token itself\n",
    "   - payload contains the actual \"claims\" about the user.\n",
    "   \n",
    ">> What are JWT attacks?\n",
    "   - JWT attacks involve a user sending modified JWTs to the server in order to achieve a malicious goal."
