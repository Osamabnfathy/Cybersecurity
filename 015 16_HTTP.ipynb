    ">> What is HTTP request smuggling?\n",
    "   - HTTP request smuggling is a technique for interfering with the way a web site processes sequences of HTTP requests that are received from one or more users.\n",
    "   -  Request smuggling vulnerabilities are often critical in nature, allowing an attacker to bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, and directly compromise other application users.\n",
    "   \n",
    ">> How do HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise?\n",
    "   - Most HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise because the HTTP/1 specification provides two different ways to specify where a request ends: the Content-Length header and the Transfer-Encoding header.\n",
    "   \n",
    ">> How to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack\n",
    "   - Classic request smuggling attacks involve placing both the Content-Length header and the Transfer-Encoding header into a single HTTP/1 request and manipulating these so that the front-end and back-end servers process the request differently. "
